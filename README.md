Auto Inbox Cleaner Tool


## How does it work?
This tool automatically archives your inbox every day, allowing you to focus on reading 
and responding to important emails without cluttering your inbox.

## How to set up:
#### 1. Go to https://script.google.com/home
#### 2. Click on "New project"
#### 3. Copy the code from Code.js
#### 4. Paste the code into your Code.gs file in the project
#### 5. (Optional) Add the label "Worked" to your Gmail account to keep track of which emails have been processed
#### 6. Create a trigger in your App Script and select "moveAllInboxesToWorked" as the bound function. We recommend setting a daily trigger for this function.
### 7. Run "moveAllInboxesToWorked" once (to give all necessarily permissions)
#### That's it! Now you can enjoy a cleaner and more organized inbox.
